### Exercise: Type Casting - Numeric Operations

#### Objective:

- Practice type casting in Java by creating a program that performs numeric operations on different data types.

#### Description:

- You should create a Java program that demonstrates type casting by performing numeric operations on different data types. 
- Create a class called NumericOperations that showcases the use of type casting for numeric calculations.

#### Intructions:

- Create a class called NumericOperations to perform numeric calculations.
- In NumericOperations, perform the following numeric operations using various data types:
  -	Addition of an int and a double.
  -	Subtraction of a float from an int.
  -	Multiplication of a short and a long.
  -	Division of double and int.
